              The One4all Gift Card is available in sterling (£) only. The Card
              is not a credit card or a charge card; nor is it a debit card
              linked to a current account. It is a prepaid card which means that
              money must be loaded onto the Card at the time of purchase. Once
              one Business Day has elapsed from the date of purchase,
              cardholders can use the Card to pay for purchases at Participating
              Retailers. The Card is issued by GVS Prepaid Limited and is
              subject to these terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Certain limits apply to the Card. A maximum value of £120* may be
              loaded onto the Card at the time of purchase; the minimum load
              value is £10. Only full £1 amounts (or multiples thereof) may be
              loaded onto the Card. Additional amounts may not be loaded onto
              the Card at any time. Interest will not be payable in respect of
              Card balances.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              You should look after the Card as we do not hold your personal
              details and we cannot link the Card to you.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              *NB: the maximum value may be different in some distributors.
              Please check before purchasing.
