      <p>
        Giving a reward as unique as your employees and customers couldn't be easier. 
        Add a personal message or personalized video to our digital gift cards. 
        It's a powerful tool for telling your recipients what they mean to you, making 
        them feel super special, and transforming what could be a generic interaction into a meaningful moment.

            can delay fund activation so that it aligns with your specific campaigns, bespoke celebrations, 
            prize draws, key milestones, special occasions, business goals, employee achievements, 
            customer engagement, or loyalty.
